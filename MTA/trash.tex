Our system consists of two major components: an automatic mesh generator and an interactive model editor.

The mesh generator can procedurally generate a realistic clay mesh by adding Perlin Noise. With the interactive pottery model editor, the user can shape the virtual clay in real time intuitively to design virtual pots.

The virtual pots created by our system can be exported as OBJ files and used for 3D printing.

The results of our user study has shown that our system requires lower cognitive load compared with desktop modeling experience and allows more creativity than touchscreen-based interfaces. Users without real-life pottery experience and 3D modeling knowledge can easily create virtual pottery works with our system.

In recent years, emerging technologies such as 3D printing introduces a new way of pot design, enabling people to fabricate pots in a digital way with the help of Computer Aided Design (CAD) software and 3D printers.

As one of the oldest inventions in human history, pottery has drawn much interests, leading to the emergence of virtual pottery systems.
